# Employee Directory

  ## Description

  This is an employee directory with React. It has a requirement to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

  ## Technologies
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This app was created with the dependency react-bootstrap-table.

  ## Usage
  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

  The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
